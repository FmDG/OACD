# OACD Repository

This is the GitHub repository of the scripts and code that members of the OACD group have created to be shared amongst 
the wider group to save time and effort.

## Use

### Copying ("taking inspiration") other ideas

There are a series of folders in the GitHub grouped into the following categories:

- Methods: Describes functions and code to carry out various data analysis techniques.
- Figures: Describes past figures and how to create them.

Each of these folders will contain a README.md file outlining how to use that particular code. Simply follow the 
instructions in the README to download the relevant code and get to using it.

### Contributing

You can also contribute to the repo with any code that you have run that you think might be useful for the wider OACD 
group to have access to. To do this, create a new folder/directory in the relevant folder which should contain all the 
information that someone would need to run the code on their machine. Inside this folder, it is important to include a 
brief README file outlining how to use the code as well as outlining any relevant prerequisite packages needed to make
code work. ALso important to include any citations if you have borrowed ideas, or are using data, from another source.
